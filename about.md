This is a world map of the [Guild Wars 2][gw2]{:target="_blank"}. It makes use of the [API][gw2api]{:target="_blank"} that is publicly available. Currently, only the map boundaries are visible, which is a direct port of an [old page](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/678063/Guild%20Wars%202/Map%20boundaries.htm){:target="_blank"} I made earlier. Now that I have moved it to GitHub pages, I have plans to clean it up and extend it with more features.

## Current features
- View the map boundaries to see how big a map actually is
