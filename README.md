## Contribute
This is supposed to be a community effort, so if you want to contribute to the
project, make a fork, add or change stuff and do a pull request. I'll review
what you've done and decide if it's viable to include it.

A couple of remarks though:
- Make a pull request to the master branch, **not** the gh-pages branch
- Once a change has no side effects, I will merge it with gh-pages
